Hey Guys! Thanks for coming to my git Workshop!

Here are some helpful commands in case you forget.

--------------------------- Dealing with Local Repository ---------------------------

$ git add .
Adds all the files in your current directory to the staging area.

$ git add *
Adds all edited, new, or removed files to the staging area.

$ git add <Regex> 
Adds any files that match a given Regex. If you don't know what this is don't worry about it. 
An example would be <$git add *.c> this would add any file that ends with .c to the staging area

$git add <filename> 
Adds the files called <filename> to the staging area

$git reset <filename> 
Remove a file from the staging area

$ git commit -m "Your Commit Message"
commits all of the changes from the staging area to the current branch of the local version of your repository. 
These changes are now perminant in that branch. (Kinda, there are ways to undo things if you really need to)

$git branch
list all of the current branches present in your local repository

$git branch <branch name> 
create a new branch called <branch name> based on the current branch

$git checkout <branch name> 
changes the current branch to be <branch name> 
The current branch is also called the HEAD

$ git merge <branch name> 
Merge all the commits from <branch name> into the current branch. CAN RESULT IN MERGE CONFLICTS!

--------------------------- Dealing with Remote Repository ---------------------------

$ git pull
Merge all the commits from the remote repository with your local repository. 

$ git push
Merge all the commits from your local repository with the remote repository.
